trustyuri-python
================

This is a Python library to generate and check _trusty URIs_ (previously called
_hash-URIs_). Trusty URIs contain cryptographic hash values that can be used to
verify the respective content.
See the [trusty URI specification](https://github.com/trustyuri/trustyuri-spec)
and the [preprint article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5775) describing the
approach.
